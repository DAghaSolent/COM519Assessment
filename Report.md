<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The project idea for this assessment was to create a product to be able to effectively track all my lifts in the gym in an easier solution compared to my previous method which was using an excel spreadsheet or pen and paper to track my workouts.</p>

<p>In addition to this I wanted to provide more details and a better picture when it comes to the raw data that is added to my application, the plan was to provide users to be able to upload photos or videos of their lifts so they can assess their form when lifting and gives more information about a specific lift than raw numerical data.</p>
